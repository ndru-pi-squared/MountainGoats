# MountainGoats
A 3D, multiplayer, third-person shooter game in which the player takes control of a sheep that can shoot bullets from its eyes. 
The game takes place on Mount Everest--I've implemented a genuine heightmap of Mount Everest into the terrain, and I plan to add 
more remarkable worldwide locations and their features. Users will be able to use a virtual cell phone to crowdsource routes up 
and down the mountain and I believe I would like to make it some sort of CTF (capture-the-flag) style game where the flag is on 
top of Everest. 

I need to either find or create a 3D goat model to make it Mountain GOATS and not just Mountain (free barnyard animal Unity asset) Sheep. 
Any suggestions: do advise.
